### General Info

This project was intended to apply what I am learning in PHP. This contact form takes in 3 input data types: a name, an email, and a message. I created a function to filter the input data by stripping it of any slashes, removing whitespace, and used the htmlspecialchars function to convert special characters to HTML entities to prevent scripting attacks. I then used if statements to check if input fields were not empty and to validate the email address. I added error messages and applied them to the HTML in the form of span elements. Lastly I created to and from variables to send the mail using the mail function.
